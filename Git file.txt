 Excel:
 ------
 ctrl + shift + L =To apply for filter			
 
 Practice program:
 -----------------
 whatever they are giveing the data i need to use this one(=Left(column number,len(same column number)-whatever charcter we need to remove))
 
 This is for orginal data (=VLookup(column number,nextpage all data,Then how many column you want give that,0))
 
 Assessment:
 -----------
 This is for main data we need to use =VLookup(column number,nextpage all data,Then how many column you want give that,0)
 
 =Round(Column number,0)&"%"
 
 
 Hacker Rank Ids is not there means we will trim/cut the email with
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 Trim/cut : =lefr(column number(Email),(len(column number(Email))-how many characters you want to remove)
 
 after complete the left formala we needs to select the near column  :=VLookup(column number,nextpage all data,Then how many column you want give that,0)
		   
 Hackerrank is there: 
 --------------------
 =VLookup(column number(H,ID),nextpage all data,Then how many column you want give that,0)
 
 =(Cl Num/Value)
